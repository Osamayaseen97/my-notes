# Introduction about me :
### My name is ***Osama Yaseen*** , I was born in Jordan in **1997**
### I studied ***civil engineering*** at ***Zarqa University*** and graduated two years ago
### I love reading, writing and learning more sciences and knowledge .

# This is my summary of what I learned
1-The design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters. You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time.

2-Your design should be easy for you and helpful for others.

3-Actually, one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.

4-Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer ,The truth is that if other developers who read your code can understand it easily it means that you are doing good.

5-Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.

6-Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.

7-All changes require maintenance,Simplicity and complexity are the two main factors that affect code maintenance,It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation

8-Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it,
In any team sport, the best teams have consistency and chemistry. 

9-The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change,The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.

10-Don’t try to solve one big problem,Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by one.

11-Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now,Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.

12-Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software.


13-The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.


14-When you can’t make the code simpler then you should add the comment to explain this complexity.

15-Don’t depend on external technologies. But when you have to do so, try to reduce your dependency on them as much as you can

14-Keep learning. Try out different programming languages and tools, read books on software development. They will give you another perspective. Every day small improvements will make a real difference in your knowledge and skills.

15-When you can’t think of anything on your own, search! Find answers and try them out. Modify those answers, see if you can understand why they work, adapt them to your code.
